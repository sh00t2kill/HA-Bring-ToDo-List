# Custom Shopping List with Bring integration.

A custom implementation of Home Assistant's new ToDo List that synchronises with Bring Shopping List (https://getbring.com/#!/app).
The original component overrode the core shopping_list integration --- this uses the new Todo list functionality, creating a todo list for each shopping list created in Bring!
## Installation

### HACS

Add the repository url to your custom repositories in HACS: https://github.com/sh00t2kill/HA-Bring-ToDo-List
and install `Bring Todo List`.



## Usage

To use it, add the shopping list integration from the integration page and fill in your credentials.
